"""Module: FREE_INFO_OPS — Information Operations Analysis for ReconPro v9.2.0.

DEFENSIVE / EDUCATIONAL ONLY — This module helps organizations understand and
mitigate risks from information operations: misattribution, impersonation,
false flag attribution, and narrative manipulation.

All capabilities are framed as **defensive assessments** that reveal how an
adversary could exploit publicly observable infrastructure signals to
deceive analysts, misdirect attribution, or construct false narratives.

Capabilities:
  1. Infrastructure Misattribution Analysis
  2. Decoy Endpoint Generation (defensive honeypot recommendations)
  3. False Flag Risk Assessment
  4. Digital Deception Resilience Scoring
  5. Narrative Vulnerability Analysis
  6. Attribution Obfuscation Detection
  7. Honeypot Integration Planning
