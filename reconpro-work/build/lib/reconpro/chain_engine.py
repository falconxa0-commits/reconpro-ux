ReconPro v7.5 — Multi-Vector Attack Path Chaining Engine

Links individual, seemingly minor findings into dangerous compound attack
paths.  Operates in three modes:

1. **Rule-based** — pattern matching against 50+ predefined ChainPattern
   rules that model real-world compound attack scenarios.
2. **Graph-based** — traverses the knowledge graph to discover paths
   between vulnerabilities that share assets, ports, or technologies.
3. **LLM-assisted** (optional) — sends findings to an LLM for
   creative/nuanced chain discovery beyond predefined rules.

Zero hard dependencies.  LLM integration uses try/except imports so the
engine works fully offline.
